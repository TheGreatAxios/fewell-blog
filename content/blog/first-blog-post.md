# About Me

I am an expert in relational therapy including, family, blended family dynamics, couples and other relational issues. I also counsel those with anger management and adjustment issues. My love for the family structure started with my upbringing within a 2 parent home and continued as I pursued my passion to becoming a therapist. I have counseled diverse family structures and have educated others on redefining the meaning of the family unit. I enjoy training other clinicians with developing their nicheâ€™ within the mental health field and providing guidance as they pursue full licensure.  I have been in private practice in North Carolina since 2007 and have also worked as a Marriage and Family Therapist and a Military Family Life Counselor on a military installation. I enjoy working with children ages 0-5 years old and have provided therapy to this age group for many years.  

So enough about my professional background, let me give you some personal stuff. I love singing and have recorded background vocals for various projects, sewing and fashion designing within my fashion business [www.tinascouturellc.com](www.tinascouturellc.com) and recently started cohosting a church news social media weekly show. Yes, I have lots of interests!
