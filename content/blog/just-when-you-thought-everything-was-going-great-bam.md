description: Triggers after divorce
---
Life of a divorced woman can be unpredictable. There are periods when you feel on top of the world and then other times something triggers a bad memory and you start to relive a situation from the marriage. I was minding my own business watching The Tamara Hall Show and the topic was ‘Married to a Mama’s boy”. UGH! That triggered something old in me. It was as if I was reliving the many times I felt like I wasn’t his priority.  You see, I was definitely married to a Mama’s boy. Watching this episode raised my blood pressure because I remembered countless times that I was the 3rd wheel. Decisions made and were changed because he didn’t set boundaries. The blame rest on all of us. I should have been clearer with my expectations, my mother in law should have adjusted her position and my ex should have overall  made it clear that I was the priority  and she was now extended family. This is just an example how the journey of divorce is ever changing. Just because you know you are over someone doesn’t mean the memories (good, bad, or ugly) will go away. What I did in the moment is not fight my feelings and just let them be. I’m not trying to understand them or question my growth. I just realize these things will happen and it’s ok. Can you relate? Am I the only one who get triggered out of no where? Drop you thoughts below.
