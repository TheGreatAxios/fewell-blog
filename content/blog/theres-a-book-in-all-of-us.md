Some of you may know, I’ve written a book called “Divorce Looks Good On You: A Girlfriend’s Guide To Moving Towards Greatness After Divorce. What you don’t know is, I had no plans to write this book because I wasn’t going to tell my story. Going through a divorce was a lonely time. I have great friends and family who attempted to support me but honestly, they didn’t help at all. I don’t blame them. They couldn’t help me through something they haven’t experienced. I learned how to cope through trial and a lot of error. I decided that this was going to be a great new chapter and I wasn’t gonna look back. Do I have bad/sad days? Heck ya! More like mad and angry days but overall, I’m good. Learning a lot about who I am and I’m love it! This blog is just me chatting about my new life after divorce. You’ll get the good bad and the ugly! Follow me on this journey and comment below!
